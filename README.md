## User Exerience: UX

### User Stories

I am a user that requires the following things when using this site;

+ Site from inital loading needs to be clear with its purpose
+ Navigation must be smooth and simple
+ Easy to read infomation that isn't too technical
+ Enable me to access the product info and how to buy
+ Straigtforward contact process
+ Be able to see Fiber Active's social presence
+ See who the developer was and what their information is

### Initial Concept
I want to set forward a professional and clean look for the website while still showing its roots in nature. keeping things uncluttered and clear will help guide the user in quickly utilising the website for their needs. Technology websites like [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/uk/), [OnePlus Website](https://www.oneplus.com/uk) and [Oxford Fabric Website](https://www.oxford-fabric.com/product/)

### Wireframes

I created my Wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Some aspects i have decided to adapt and change due to accomodating design features or requierments that weren't originally anticipated.

### Site Structure

Fabric Active is 3 pages with the home page being the landing page and all pages and social links accessible from all pages allowing for easy navigation.

### Colour Scheme

Finding a complementry colour scheme that doesn't distract from the goals of the website has been tricky while maintaining an aspect of nature in the features. I had settled on my HEro image and used [My Color space webiste](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F76C53&sub=1) to help selct my colour pallette from there.
I decided to keep the 
+586BA4 Replaced with 45477D 
+324376
+F5DD90 Replaced with F8E8BF
+F68E5F
+F76C53

I replaced two of the above colours due to checking on [Web Aim Website](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and my original colours not passing all the contrast tests.

### Typography

The two fonts selected are Odswald and Figtree imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 
With Sans-serif as the back-up font incase the other fonts do not load.

### Imagery

I have tried to maintain a link to nature with the imagery for the site.
By using a site like [compressor.io] to compress the files this should allow for faster loading times.
