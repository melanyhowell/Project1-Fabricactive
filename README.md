## User Exerience: UX

### Initial Concept
I want to set forward a professional and clean look for the website while still showing its roots in nature. keeping things uncluttered and clear will help guide the user in quickly utilising the website for their needs. Technology websites like [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/uk/), [OnePlus Website](https://www.oneplus.com/uk), [National Gallery](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/) and [Oxford Fabric Website](https://www.oxford-fabric.com/product/)

### User Stories

I am a user that requires the following things when using this site;

+ Site from inital loading needs to be clear with its purpose
+ Navigation must be smooth and simple
+ Easy to read infomation that isn't too technical
+ Enable me to access request the product info and how to buy
+ Straigtforward contact process
+ Be able to see Fiber Active's social presence
+ See who the developer was and what their information is

As the owner I want the following from my site;

+ Clear & professional presence
+ Background on company
+ Info on product ranges
+ Ways for people to get in contact with us

As a developer I am looking to provide the following;

+ Easy to use and accessible
+ Tidy professional look
+ Makes visitors want to explore/return
+ satisfies Owner and vistitors needs


### Wireframes

I created my Wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Some aspects I have decided to adapt and change due to accomodating design features or requierments that weren't originally anticipated.

#### Home Page

#### Product/Services Page

#### Contact Form Page

![Contact Page Wireframes](assets/readme-images/contact-page-wirframes.png)

#### Form Confirmation Page

![Confirmation Page Wireframes](assets/readme-images/formconfirmation-page-wirframes.png)


### Site Structure

Fabric Active is 3 pages with the home page being the landing page and all pages and social links accessible from all pages allowing for easy navigation.
4th page is the Page confirming submission of the contact form

### Colour Pallette

Finding a complementry colour pallette that doesn't distract from the goals of the website has been tricky while maintaining an aspect of nature in the features. I used both  [My Color space webiste](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F76C53&sub=1) to help selct my colour pallette from there.

![Colour Pallette](assets/readme-images/Colour%20Pallet.png)

I used [Web Aim Website](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and my original colours not passing all the contrast tests.

![Colour check](assets/readme-images/Colour%20check.png)


### Typography

The two fonts selected are Odswald and Figtree imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
I chose these fonts as they bring a casual look to the site while still maintaining a professional visual.

### Imagery

Relating the images back to the eco-friendly product descriptions.
By using a site like [compressor.io] to compress the files this should allow for faster loading times.
